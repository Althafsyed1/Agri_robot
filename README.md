# Multipurpose_Agri_robot
# Semiautonomous
A Multitasking robot for the field of Agriculture has been studied in this research. Now a day, precision agriculture by agricultural robots is the newly emerging technology in agriculture sector to save the time and energy that is wasted in repetitive farming tasks automation in farming processes is quite helpful. To design these sorts of robots there should be certain considerations and particular approach considering the agriculture environment in which it will be working. The working of an autonomous robot is based on field parameters i.e. length and width. Prototype of an agricultural robot “Agro-Bot” is modeled for multitasking such as seeding, ploughing and harvesting with a separate irrigation system and also soil moisture measuring using sensors and that data is transmitted to our smart mobile with solar power. It is a four wheeled vehicle which is controlled by nodemcu esp-8266 microcontroller (Arduino) as master controller, it is powered with battery so It will also help in decreasing the use of nonrenewable sources of energy and will not pollute the environment. Other accessories are slaves performing specific operations. The approach is now to develop smarter machines that are intelligent enough to work in an unmodified or semi natural environment.
